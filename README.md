About the design

---

As I enjoy reading but sometimes struggle to make time for it I have thought that a reading challenge would be helpful - and why not create a web page for it myself?

I wanted a clean but informative design with a contrasting color palette to clearly distinguish the background from buttons and card elements. The background has a purple color and the buttons and footer is yellow. The colors were chosen as they are on the opposite side of the color wheel and thus looks good in combination. As I find dark designs to be more relaxing to look at, which is the feeling I want the user to get, I decied on a dark background color with light fonts.

For good readability, and because I like the look of them, I chose Roboto Mono as the body text font and the serif font Domine to create contrast between headings and body text.

The buttons have rounded corners to give a softer impression but as I wanted a flat design, no drop shadows, borders or such are used. The color of the buttons changes on different states however for better user experience.

A hamburger menu is used to make the design clear in mobile and tablet mode. However as there is a lot of space in desktop mode, I chose to have the menu items printed as there are only three menu options.
In mobile and desktop view when the menu is open, I chose to let the menu cover all the content on the screen as I think it would look a bit cluttered otherwise.
